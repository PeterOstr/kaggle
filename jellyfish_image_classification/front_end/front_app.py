        * We predicting 6 types of Jellyfish:
            - Moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita): Common jellyfish with four horseshoe-shaped gonads visible through the 
            top of its translucent bell. It feeds by collecting medusae, plankton, and mollusks with its tentacles.
            - Barrel jellyfish (Rhizostoma pulmo): Largest jellyfish found in British waters, with a bell that can grow
             up to 90 cm in diameter. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.
            - Blue jellyfish (Cyanea lamarckii): Large jellyfish that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. It feeds on 
            plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.
            - Compass jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella): Named after the brown markings on its bell that resemble a 
            compass rose. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.
            - Lionâ€™s mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata): Largest jellyfish in the world, with a bell 
            that can grow up to 2 meters in diameter and tentacles that can reach up to 30 meters in length. It feeds on plankton and small fish by catching them in its tentacles.
            - Mauve stinger (Pelagia noctiluca): Small jellyfish with long tentacles 
            and warty structures on its bell full of stinging cells. It feeds on other small jellyfish and oceanic sea squirts.

st.write(""" ### About this app here

Initializing the FastAPI Application: A web application is created using FastAPI, which handles HTTP requests.

Image Processing: Users can upload images through the web interface of the application.

Predicting Jellyfish Type in the Image: Upon uploading an image, the application utilizes a neural network to 
analyze the image and predict the type of jellyfish present in it.

Image Classification using ResNet50: Additionally, the application can classify the image using a pre-trained 
ResNet50 model to determine its content.

Application Response: After processing the image, the application returns the result to the user, such as the
 predicted jellyfish type or image classification.

Error Handling: The application ensures handling of potential errors that may occur during image upload and processing.
